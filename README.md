# Pro7LooksHelper-AppleScript
An AppleScript "App" that adds a Pro7 Looks-Menu to your MacOS menu-bar, so you can can always see the current look (and quickly choose a new look).

This is a working "proof of concept". I probably "should have" used a different technology like Electron or even a native app in XCode - but I wanted something quick and fast, as I live in hope that RV will add topmost display of current look as a new feature in Pro7 itself one day soon-ish.

1. Open Apple "Script Editor"
2. Make a new empty script.
3. Paste code from Pro7LooksHelper.applescript (or download and open in Apple Script Editor)
4. Save as "Pro7LooksHelper.app" using File Format: Application (with "Stay open after run handler" option checked)
5. You now haev an "App" almost ready to run and use....but first, you need to allow it to control your computer in security settings by following the next two steps.
6. Right-click the application and select Open
7. Follow prompts to allow "Pro7LooksHelper.app" to control your computer in "Accessibility: Privacy" settings
8. After above steps, you can double-click to open the application normally anytime in the future.
